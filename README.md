# DataScienceJobsProject
An in depth analysis into the current state of Data Science jobs in the year 2023.
I wanted to create an intutive project to analyze jobs in the data science field.
I sought out to answer the five questions listed below:

1.) What are the top-paying jobs for my role?
2.) What are the skills required for these top-paying jobs?
3.) What are the most in-demand skills for my role?
4.) What are the top skills based on salary for my role?
5.) What are the most optimal skills to learn?
